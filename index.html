        <h1>The Idea</h1>
        <p>
            Recently with the advent of social media and more a more digitized medium in regards to consuming art, the value of the statue has been forgotten
            To a large subsection of the population. People seem to be interested in what’s on their phone instead of what’s infront of them.
            With art diversifying and growing at a dizzying pace, it seems natural to forget about our cultural history but it’s become
            more critical then ever to take what was learned in the past and re-articulate it, less we make the same mistakes as our ancestors.

            Welcome to Ube’s Waiting Room - a website dedicated to explaining the complexities of sculpture specifically within Africa, Latin America and Asia culture.
            This is an online experience to explain how the cultural importance of sculpture - especially when observed within a non-Westernized context.


            Statutes serve an important function in per-serving human culture. When observing the craftsmanship and the the overall features of a statue,  hidden social phenomena’s can be
            revealed quite easily. They serve to reveal roles, responsibilities, personifications, assumptions about an insane amount of a culture’s populus. For example,
            Within African art, the exaggeration of certain physical characteristics can indicate so much about the society’s view on the trait.

            Please traverse this page to find out more about the intersection of gender roles, societal standards, and examples of these other traits in other cultures as well.
