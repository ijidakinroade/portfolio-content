        <h1>Worldwide Similarities</h1>
        <p>
          While the world’s culture’s are incredibly diverse and almost countless, there will always remain similarities across countless topics, with art being one of them. As we
          Are focusing on African sculpture for this lesson, we’ll be explaining the commonalities and differences between African sculpture and how sculpture was viewed in other traditional
          Cultural contexts as well: mainly Latin American & American culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          A commonality amongst world cultures and African sculpture culture, is the story that culture’s religion tells. A commonality can be seen within both Indian sculpture and African sculpture
          As both regions place an immense amount of importance on religion and this importance can be seen within the sculpture of both regions. Both India and Africa contain numerous sculptures
          That depict religious figures and the traits and lessons these figures have for their followers. Keeping these pieces most likely carried with it heavy religious and moral reasons for both the creators
          And the sculptors.
